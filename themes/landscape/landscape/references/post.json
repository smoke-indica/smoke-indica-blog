I need to implement some Low Stress Training (LST) for this plant because it\'s going to be the only plant in the flowering tent for the next harvest.  The goal is to have this one plant occupy the space of two plants. In order to do that, I need this plant to be wide and bushy from a young age.\n\nThe plant is currently about 16" tall and 14" wide. I\'ve topped this plant twice already, which is why it looks like a mushroom cap. I also keep the lower branches trimmed as it\'s growing, and that allows all of the energy to go to the branches that will end up being the main colas. \n\nI need this plant to be at least 3-feet tall and 3-feet wide before it goes into my 2x4x7 modified flowering tent. I increased the height of my flowering tent by 2-feet by adding a frame to the bottom and cutting the floor out of the tent and mounting it on top of my new framework, which allows the plants to grow taller without the colas hitting the light that used to have a 5-foot maximum ceiling height.\n\n<a href=\'then the png or jpg adress\'><br><center><h4>2x4x7 MODIFIED FLOWERING TENT</h4></center></a>\n\n![tent.jpg](https://img.smoke.io/img0/writer43/9cb431e986eea3f1a305ecc6eb38f863d03bd850.jpeg)\n\nOnce this plant goes into the tent, I will stretch the branches out even further by using a scrog net. Before I put this plant into flower? I will let the scrog net do its thing by generating more bud sites. Once the plant has filled all of the holes in the 8sqft scrog net, I will change the light to a 12/12 schedule, and start the flowing cycle.\n\nHowever, before all of this becomes a reality? I need to LST my plant. I start this process by topping the plant a couple of times, then I use bamboo sticks. I place bamboo sticks in at different angles to spread apart the main shoots, which allows new growth to develop. After a week or so of using the bamboo sticks? I will LST the plant to a more severe level by using string to pull the branches over. I also cut slits in the rim of my plastic pots and use them to hold the string down.\n\nThis is a delicate process that requires visual inspections on a daily basis because if the string is too tight, it will sever the branches!!! I usually tie them down pretty good for the first day or two, then I will gradually release the tension on the string as the plant adjusts to the abuse, and sometimes I will move the string to another section on the branch, so I don\'t cause too much damage in one area.\n\n<a href=\'then the png or jpg adress\'><br><center><h4>LST BAMBOO STICKS</h4></center></a>\n\n![012.jpg](https://img.smoke.io/img0/writer43/28d633ea721d4170fd9e4ad0c49382ddb13062c5.jpeg)\n\n![013.jpg](https://img.smoke.io/img0/writer43/e0f48effcb3a3d17b08a161a01a9495fe59111e5.jpeg)\n\nI have about another week to go before I can tie the branches over with the string lines.
